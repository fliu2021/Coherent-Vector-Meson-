This repository aims to study vector meson production at UPCs at Muon-Ion Collider, EIC, LHeC. The event generotor is eSTARlight

*************************************************************DOWNLOAD eSTARlight*******************************************************
eSTARlight:https://github.com/eic/estarlight

Please follow the instructions on the above website or the below steps:
1.make a directory where you would like to store eSTARlight,see "/home/fl52/MuIC", so type:
mkdir MuIC 

2. type:
cd MuIC

3.Try to download the code of eSTARLlight by simply typing: 
git clone https://github.com/eic/estarlight.git
(make sure you have found "estarlight" in the "MuIC" directory)

4.Type:
cd estarlight 
mkdir build 
cd build 
cmake ..
make 

5.After step4, you will find "e_starlight" in the "estarlight/build" directory.
The e_starlight is the executable, you can simply run it by type "./e_starlight". But before that, you need to modify inputfile, to do that see next secions.
***********************************************************How to generate events with eSTARlight?****************************************
Before you start generating events, try to decide the following parameters:
(i)TARGET beam type: TARGET_BEAM_Z, TARGET_BEAM_A 
(ii)energy of two beams: ELECTRON_BEAM_GAMMA, TARGET_BEAM_GAMMA 
!!!IMPORTANT!!! the GAMMA is the Lorentz factor: ELECTRON_BEAM_GAMMA=E/m_e in the God-Given unit（h_bar=c=1）, E is the energy of electron beam,m_e is the electron mass;
                                                 TARGET_BEAM_GAMMA  =E/m_A in the God-Given unit（h_bar=c=1）, E is the energy of ion      beam,m_A is the ion      mass;

A reference table: will appear in the near future 

(iii) number of events you would like to genetate: N_EVENTS
(iV) which type of vector meson you woule like to generate: PROD_PID 
To generate J/psi->mu+mu-, set PROD_PID=443013
(V) Q2 range: MIN_GAMMA_Q2, MAX_GAMMA_Q2
you can set MIN_GAMMA_Q2=0 & MAX_GAMMA_Q2=1000, so that you do not want to apply a cut on Q2 

If you have figured out the above parameters , congratulate! you are just one step from having your own Vector Meson. 

Type: 
cd /home/fl52/MuIC/estarlight/
ls ./

You will see a file named as "slight.in". To see it, type 
vim slight.in

Then, find "TARGET_BEAM_Z","TARGET_BEAM_A","N_EVENTS","ELECTRON_BEAM_GAMMA","TARGET_BEAM_GAMMA","PROD_PID","MIN_GAMMA_Q2","MAX_GAMMA_Q2"
and modify them.

Here comes the last step, type:
cd build 
mv ../slight.in ./
./e_starlight  

You will be able to find "slight.out", which contains generated events.
